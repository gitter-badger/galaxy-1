Comet
=====

> A development platform for building awesome JavaScript apps.

:warning: This platform is still under construction.

Comet is an application runtime currently under construction that allows users
to efficiently build great JavaScript applications. It is targeted at
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), the browser, and any runtime that is supported by
our plugin system.

Comet tries to make use of the latest technologies and best practices, such as generators, DI, macros, and many more, and attempts to make these technologies both accessible and easy to use for the end user. Writing great applications should be fun, not cumbersome.
