Plugins
=======

Plugins extend Comet's core functionality to provide some usefull new
functionality, such as TypeScript compilation, Dependency Injection (DI),
server-side rendering (SSR), and so on. Evidently, plugins can build further
upon other plugins, making complex behavior possible.

View a list of which things can be extended at the [class providers](https://github.com/comet-platform/comet-runtime/wiki/Class-providers).
